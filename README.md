2. Populate the Script TagCopy all the JavaScript code from the previous React component block (starting from // --- Helper Functions --- down to the end of the App function, including all helper functions and components).Paste this entire block of code inside the <script type="text/babel"> tag in the index.html file above, replacing the placeholder comments like /* ... copy from previous code ... */.Important: Remove the import React... line and the export default App; line from the code you paste, as React is loaded via CDN and the App function is called directly at the end of the script.3. Deploy to GitHub PagesCreate GitHub Repository: Create a new public repository on GitHub (e.g., cinder-spires-site).Upload File: Upload the completed index.html file (with the React code pasted inside the script tag) to the main branch of your repository.Enable GitHub Pages:Go to your repository settings on GitHub.Navigate to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar.Under "Build and deployment", select "Deploy from a branch".Choose the main branch (or whichever branch you uploaded the file to) and the / (root) folder.Click "Save".Wait and Access: GitHub will build and deploy your page. It might take a few minutes. Your site will be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/.Important Considerations:Performance: This method uses in-browser JSX transpilation via the Babel CDN. This is not recommended for production sites as it adds significant load time for users. It's fine for demos or personal projects.Standard Practice: For real-world React deployment, you would set up a project using a tool like Vite or Create React App. These tools provide a development server, build optimizations, and generate static files (index.html, bundled JS/CSS) in a dist or build folder, which is what you'd typically deploy to GitHub Pages using tools like gh-pages.AOS Refresh: I've added a useEffect in the App component to refresh AOS when the page changes, ensuring animations trigger correctly on newly rendered content. A small timeout helps ensure the DOM is updated first. I also added a scroll-to-top on page change.This approach allows you to deploy the React code directly using GitHub Pages with minimal setup, suitable for sharing your interactive Cinder Spires reference site.
